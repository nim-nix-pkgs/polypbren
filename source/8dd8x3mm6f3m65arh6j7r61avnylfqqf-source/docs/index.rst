Overview
========


Polypbren is a program that computes the renormalized parameters (renormalized charges and screening length) for dispersions of
charged spherical particles with arbitrary size distributions. The surface charge of the colloids can be fixed or regulated by pH.
The Poisson-Boltzmann Cell Model and Renormalized Jellium Model are implemented.
This `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09542>`_ details the calculations it was designed for.
See also the `References`_ for more information on the scientific part.

Building
========

You will need the `Nim compiler <https://nim-lang.org/>`_ to compile this program. 
The installation instructions are `here <https://nim-lang.org/install.html>`_. 


The following command line

::
   nimble install polypbren

will download the source files, compile an executable (``polypbren.exe`` on windows, ``polypbren`` elsewhere). 
The binary is installed by default in ``~/.nimble/bin``
(or elsewhere depending on your nimble setting and OS).

Alternatively the whole repository (including examples) can be downloaded:

::
   git clone https://github.com/guibar64/polypbren.git

or with ``nimble develop``:

::
   nimble develop polypbren
   
Then the main program can be manually compiled following the command lines,

::
   
    cd polypbren
    nim c -d:release src/polypbren 

The generated executable is in the  ``src`` directory.
The ``-d:release`` flag is for a release build, skip it if you want stack traces, checks etc... but it is then much slower.

Usage
=====

Assuming `polypbren` is in your path,

::
    polypbren -h

will print an help message.

See `Usage <usage.html>`_ for more information on input files and parameters.

Solver
======

The module `pbsolv <pbsolv.html>`_ implements a simple solver for the 1-D Poisson-Boltzmann equation.
